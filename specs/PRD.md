**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Product Name:** EGO Insight – Explainable AI Platform for Brain Development Assessment
**Document Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 01 01, 2026

### **1. Users & Value**

*   **Primary User:** **Pediatric Neurologists**
    *   **Pains:** Relies on subjective scales; lacks objective biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., ASD).
    *   **Gains:** An objective, data-driven tool providing a quantified report of cortical maturity and visual explanation of key neural features (e.g., Early Gamma Oscillations) to aid diagnosis and track progress.

*   **Secondary User:** **Neuroscience Researchers**
    *   **Pains:** Lacks standardized tools to analyze complex neurodevelopmental data and interpret AI models.
    *   **Gains:** An open-source SDK with core explainable AI (XAI) algorithms for hypothesis generation and validation of new biomarkers.

*   **Value Proposition:** EGO Insight translates proven neuroscience on **Early Gamma Oscillations** into a clinical, interpretable AI platform. We provide not just a developmental age estimate, but **visual insights** into underlying neural synchrony to enable earlier, more informed clinical decisions.

### **2. Scope & Non-Goals**

*   **In Scope (MVP):**
    1.  Secure clinician portal for uploading anonymized EEG/evoked potential data.
    2.  Automated analysis pipeline: 1D CNN with temporal attention, adaptive thresholding, and Grad-CAM visualization.
    3.  Interactive report showing **predicted developmental age (90% accuracy)**, **Grad-CAM heatmaps**, and **quantified Temporal Gradient**.
    4.  Open-source Researcher SDK with core model and XAI modules.

*   **Non-Goals:**
    *    **Not an autonomous diagnostic device.**
    *    **Not a real-time monitor or consumer product.**
    *    **Not a general-purpose EEG analysis software.**

### **3. KPIs & Constraints**

*   **KPIs:**
    *   **Model Accuracy:** >85% on independent clinical validation set.
    *   **User Adoption:** >50 Clinician NPS; average report generation time <5 min.
    *   **Research Utility:** >1000 annual SDK downloads.

*   **Constraints:**
    *   Must comply with SaMD regulations (data privacy, security, QMS).
    *   Must operate within secure, offline clinical IT environments.
    *   All data must be anonymized; ethical data sourcing is mandatory.

### **4. Risk Framing**

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clinical Misuse** | Over-reliance on AI output, bypassing clinical judgment. | 1. Clear "Auxiliary Tool" labeling on all outputs.<br>2. Mandatory clinical notes field in report workflow.<br>3. Comprehensive clinician training program. |
| **Data Security Breach** | Unauthorized access to sensitive patient neural data. | 1. End-to-end encryption & strict anonymization.<br>2. On-premise or compliant private cloud deployment.<br>3. Pursue relevant security certifications (e.g., ISO 27001). |
| **Model Generalization Failure** | Performance drop in new patient populations or conditions. | 1. Clear definition of intended use population for MVP.<br>2. Establish a continuous performance monitoring system.<br>3. Plan for iterative model validation with diverse multi-center data. |

### **5. Sign-off**
